    <h1>Formatted Paragraph</h1>
    <p>
      The paragraph tag p is used, quite simply, to mark up paragraphs of text.The p element is one of the most commonly used building blocks of HTML. When you use the p element to begin a new paragraph in HTML, it automatically creates a line space above and below the content.
    </p>

    <xmp>
      <p>
        This is the first paragraph in the example about the P tag. There really
        isn't much to say here.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        This is the second paragraph. Again, more of the same. This time the
        paragraph is aligned in the center. This might not be such a good idea as
        it makes the text hard to read.
      </p>
      <p align="right">
        Here the paragraph is aligned to the right. Right-aligned text is also
        troublesome to read. The rest of the text of this paragraph is of little
        importance.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Under HTML 4.0-compliant browsers, you are able to justify text. As you
        may notice, the way browsers tend to justify text is sometimes imprecise.
        Furthermore, not all browsers support this attribute value.
      </p>
  
    </xmp>

    <h1>Preformatted Paragraph</h1>
    <p>
      The &lt;PRE&gt; and </PRE> tags can be used to surround text that shouldn’t be formatted by the browser. The text enclosed within the &lt;PRE&gt; tags retains all spacing and returns, and doesn’t reflow when the browser is resized. Scroll bars and horizontal scrolling are required if the lines are longer than the width of the window. The browser generally renders the preformatted text in a monospaced font, usually Courier. Some text formatting, such as bold, italics, or links, can be used within the &lt;PRE&gt; tags.
    </p>
