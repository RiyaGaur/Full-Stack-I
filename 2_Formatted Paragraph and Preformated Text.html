        <p style="color: chocolate;">The p element is one of the most commonly used building blocks of HTML.               Hello!                
           When you use the p element to begin a new paragraph in HTML, it automatically
           creates a line space above and below the content.</p>


        <p>This element may contain any text content, but it can’t include any block-level elements: 
            only inline or phrase elements can be included. The P element has an attribute called align 
            that will center the content inside the two paragraphs.</p>

        <pre style="font-family: cursive; color: blue;">The pre tags can be used to surround text that shouldn’t be                      formatted by the browser. The text enclosed within the pre tags retains all spacing and returns, and doesn’t reflow when the browser is resized. Scroll bars and horizontal scrolling are required if the lines are longer than the width of the window. The browser generally renders the preformatted text in a monospaced font, usually Courier. Some text formatting, such as bold, italics, or links, can be used within the pre tags.</PRE>

        <pre>The pre element in this example displays as shown in below.            The second part of the figure shows the same content marked up as a paragraph (p) element for comparison.</pre>

        <p>
            This is the first paragraph in the example about the P tag. There really
            isn't much to say here.
          </p>
          <p align="center">
            This is the second paragraph. Again, more of the same. This time the
            paragraph is aligned in the center. This might not be such a good idea as
            it makes the text hard to read.
          </p>
          <p align="right">
            Here the paragraph is aligned to the right. Right-aligned text is also
            troublesome to read. The rest of the text of this paragraph is of little
            importance.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Under HTML 4.0-compliant browsers, you are able to justify text. As you
            may notice, the way browsers tend to justify text is sometimes imprecise.
            Furthermore, not all browsers support this attribute value.
