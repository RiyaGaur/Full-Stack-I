        The HTML <div> tag is used to group the large section of HTML elements together.

        We know that every tag has a specific purpose e.g. p tag is used to specify paragraph, <h1> to <h6> tag are used to specify headings but the <div> tag is just like a container unit which is used to encapsulate other page elements and divides the HTML documents into sections.
            
        The div tag is generally used by web developers to group HTML elements together and apply CSS styles to many elements at once. For example: If you wrap a set of paragraph elements into a div element so you can take the advantage of CSS styles and apply font style to all paragraphs at once instead of coding the same style for each paragraph element.
            
            Div tag is Block level tag
            It is a generic container tag
            It is used to the group of various tags of HTML so that sections can be created and style can be applied to them.
        As we know Div tag is block-level tag in this example div tag contain entire width. It will be displayed div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.

              A block-level element is one that contains a significant block of content that should be displayed on its own line, to break apart long passages of text into manageable portions such as paragraphs, headings, and lists.  Many nonempty, block-level elements can contain other block-level elements, and all can contain text and inline elements.
