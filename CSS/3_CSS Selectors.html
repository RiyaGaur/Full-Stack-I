    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
    <h2>Type Selectors</h2> 
    <p>
        This is the same selector we have seen above. Again, one more example to give a color to all level 1 headings −
    </p>
    <xmp>

        h1 {
            color: #36cfff;
        }
    </xmp>

    <h4 style="color: brown;">Implementation: <a href="https://riyagaur.github.io/Full-Stack-I/CSS/Selectors/3.1_Type%20Selectors.html">Type Selector</a></h4>
    
    <h2>The Universal Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches the name of any element type −
    </p>
    <xmp>

        * {
            color: #000000;
          }

    </xmp>

    <h4 style="color: brown;">Implementation: <a href="Selectors/3.2_Universal Selectors.html">Universal Selector</a></h4>

    <h2>The Descendant Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular element. As given in the following example, style rule will apply to &lt;em&gt; element only when it lies inside &lt;ul&gt; tag.
    </p>
    <xmp>
        
        ul em {
            color: #000000;
          }

    </xmp>
    <h2>The Class Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the elements having that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.
    </p>
    <xmp>
        .black {
            color: #000000;
          }
    </xmp>
    <h2>The ID Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        You can define style rules based on the id attribute of the elements. All the elements having that id will be formatted according to the defined rule.
    </p>
    <xmp>
        #black {
            color: #000000;
          }
    </xmp>
    <h2>The Child Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        You have seen the descendant selectors. There is one more type of selector, which is very similar to descendants but have different functionality. Consider the following example −
    </p>
    <xmp>
        body > p {
            color: #000000;
          }
    </xmp>
    <h2>The Attribute Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        You can also apply styles to HTML elements with particular attributes. The style rule below will match all the input elements having a type attribute with a value of text −
    </p>
    <xmp>
        input[type='text'] {
            color: #000000;
          }
    </xmp>
    <p>
        There are following rules applied to attribute selector.
        <ul>
            <li>p[lang] − Selects all paragraph elements with a lang attribute.</li>

            <li>p[lang="fr"] − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute has a value of exactly "fr".</li>

            <li>p[lang~="fr"] − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains the word "fr".</li>

            <li>p[lang|="en"] − Selects all paragraph elements whose lang attribute contains values that are exactly "en", or begin with "en-".</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Multiple Style Rules</h2>
    <p>
        You may need to define multiple style rules for a single element. You can define these rules to combine multiple properties and corresponding values into a single block as defined in the following example −
    </p>
    <xmp>
        h1 {
            color: #36c;
            font-weight: normal;
            letter-spacing: 0.4em;
            margin-bottom: 1em;
            text-transform: lowercase;
          }
    </xmp>
    <h2>Grouping Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        You can apply a style to many selectors if you like. Just separate the selectors with a comma, as given in the following example −
    </p>
    <xmp>
        h1, h2, h3 {
            color: #36C;
            font-weight: normal;
            letter-spacing: .4em;
            margin-bottom: 1em;
            text-transform: lowercase;
         } 
    </xmp>
    <p>
        You can combine the various id selectors together as shown below −
    </p>
    <xmp>
        #content,
        #footer,
        #supplement {
            position: absolute;
            left: 510px;
            width: 200px;
        } 
    </xmp>
</body>
